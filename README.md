Pointers To Be Considered

### Tools, Technology & Project
* You should know all the words and its meaning written in the resume.
* Just for sake of writing and making the resume more fancy & appealing don't mention the tools and technologies that you are unaware of.
* It's not necessary to mention 2 or 3 projects. One project is also enough. But you did mention 2 projects also fine.
* You should know about your project (Application) really well with all the different modules available in it.
* Try to mention the technical skills on the first page of the resume.


### Formatting & General Mentioning
* Resume should be of 2 - 3 pages not more than that.
* Choose some decent font which will be easy to read.
* Don't attach your photograph in your resume until it is asked by the recruiter.
* No need for writing the end declaration of the resume
* Mentioning your job location is enough if there is left out space at the end of page then you can mention the personal details. (Ex. Father full name, Address, etc)
* While sharing the resume it should be in PDF format only.
* The name of the resume should be FirstName_LastName_+XYearsExp_ProfileName.pdf
Profile Name - Ex. Automation Tester, QA_Engg, TestEngineer
* No need of adding up a separate column for your education, College/University,
And respective percentages. Can just mention the branch of UG or UG & PG both with years of passing & university in one or two lines.
